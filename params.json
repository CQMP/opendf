{"name":"opendf","tagline":"Condensed matter physics, strong correlations, dual fermions","body":"#### Overview\r\n**opendf** - a code to evaluate dual fermion (DF) diagrams to solve strongly correlated lattice problems on the lattice (a.k.a. Hubbard model at finite dimensions). It works with a conjuction with DMFT or any other method that produces input for DF calculations : local Green's functions, hybridization functions and vertex functions. \r\n\r\nAn example of input data is provided with unhybridized atomic limic data, generated by `tools/generate_atomic.cpp'. \r\n\r\n##### Installation\r\nThe installation is a standard cmake-based procedure. To compile (on POSIX os):\r\n- make some temporary directory, change to that directory and run :\r\n`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PATH_TO_INSTALL_LOCATION} ${PATH_TO_CODE}`.\r\n- customize cmake options, if some dependencies are not found (see description below or run ccmake for experts). By default testing is enabled: it can be disabled with `-DTesting=OFF`.\r\n- `make`\r\n- `make test` (optional) \r\n- `make install`\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Dependencies:\r\n- c++11 - compatible c++ compiler\r\n- *cmake*\r\n- *eigen3* (header-only) : http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/. CMake option: `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_eigen3_headers`.\r\n- *fftw*. Cmake option : `-DFFTW_ROOT=path_to_fftw_prefix` (that is before include or lib).\r\n- *gftools* (header-only;  https://github.com/aeantipov/gftools; fetched automatically during build). Optionally can be fetched, installed and the location given by `-DGFTOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR`.\r\n- *ALPSCore* : http://alpscore.org/. CMake option : `-DALPS_ROOT=path_to_alpscore_prefix`. The following alpscore dependencies are required:\r\n  - *Boost*. Cmake option : `-DBOOST_ROOT=path_to_boost_prefix`.\r\n  - *MPI*\r\n  - *HDF5* . Cmake option : `-DHDF5_ROOT=path_to_hdf5_prefix`.\r\n  - *gtest* for testing\r\n  - *Doxygen* (optional)\r\n   \r\n**NB**: Since c++11 support is required for the code to work, c++ dependencies (in particular, *alpscore* and *boost*) are required to be compiled in c++11 mode. \r\n\r\n##### License \r\nGPLv2. \r\n\r\n##### Academic usage. \r\nPlease provide a citation.\r\n\r\n##### Copyright\r\nAndrey E.
