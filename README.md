#### Overview
**opendf** - a code to evaluate dual fermion (DF) diagrams to solve strongly correlated lattice problems on the lattice (a.k.a. Hubbard model at finite dimensions). It works with a conjuction with DMFT or any other method that produces input for DF calculations : local Green's functions, hybridization functions and vertex functions. 

An example of input data is provided with unhybridized atomic limic data, generated by `tools/generate_atomic.cpp'. 

##### Installation
The installation is a standard cmake-based procedure. To compile (on POSIX os):
- make some temporary directory, change to that directory and run :
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PATH_TO_INSTALL_LOCATION} ${PATH_TO_CODE}`.
- customize cmake options, if some dependencies are not found (see description below or run ccmake for experts). By default testing is enabled: it can be disabled with `-DTesting=OFF`.
- `make`
- `make test` (optional) 
- `make install`


##### Dependencies:
- c++11 - compatible c++ compiler
- *cmake*
- *eigen3* (header-only) : http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/. CMake option: `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_eigen3_headers`.
- *fftw*. Cmake option : `-DFFTW_ROOT=path_to_fftw_prefix` (that is before include or lib).
- *gftools* (header-only;  https://github.com/aeantipov/gftools; fetched automatically during build). Optionally can be fetched, installed and the location given by `-DGFTOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR`.
- *ALPSCore* : http://alpscore.org/. CMake option : `-DALPS_ROOT=path_to_alpscore_prefix`. The following alpscore dependencies are required:
  - *Boost*. Cmake option : `-DBOOST_ROOT=path_to_boost_prefix`.
  - *MPI*
  - *HDF5* . Cmake option : `-DHDF5_ROOT=path_to_hdf5_prefix`.
  - *gtest* for testing
  - *Doxygen* (optional)
   
**NB**: Since c++11 support is required for the code to work, c++ dependencies (in particular, *alpscore* and *boost*) are required to be compiled in c++11 mode.
